		"What makes someone crazy?  We all have those moments when we decide how much we want to fit in and conform to the norms of our peers.  We discuss the labels we use to describe the differences between the acceptable and the eccentric.  Does our craziness help or hurt us?  Where does this arise in our subconscious?",
		"If it sounds like we are having fun, it is because we are bonkers!",
